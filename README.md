# Music Recommendation App
This is a side project for a music recommendation app called "Favorite Music of the Day". The app allows users to share their favorite music tracks every day and discover new songs based on their friends' recommendations. The app leverages multiple streaming services APIs to suggest to the user the music they have listened to the most each day.

## Features
Favorite Music of the Day: Users can add their favorite music tracks of the day to share with their friends. This feature encourages music discovery and sharing among friends.

Music Recommendations: The app suggests music tracks to users based on their listening history and the recommendations shared by their friends. By leveraging multiple streaming services APIs, the app provides personalized music recommendations.

Streaming Services Integration: The app integrates with popular streaming services APIs to access the user's listening history, playlists, and favorite tracks. This integration allows for accurate and personalized music recommendations.

## Technologies Used
Frontend: The frontend of the app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It utilizes a modern framework like React or Vue.js to create an interactive and responsive user interface.

Backend: The backend is implemented using a server-side language such as Node.js or Python. It interacts with the streaming services APIs, processes user requests, and provides recommendations.

Database: A database system like MySQL or MongoDB is used to store user profiles, favorite tracks, and other relevant data.

Streaming Services APIs: The app leverages the APIs provided by popular streaming services like Spotify, Apple Music, or Deezer to access user data, retrieve track information, and generate recommendations.
